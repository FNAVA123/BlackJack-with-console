# BlackJack-with-console
A basic blackjack game using console for the visual

The program simulates a game of Blackjack, a popular card game played between a player and a dealer. The player starts with a certain amount of money and can place bets on each round. The game begins by dealing two cards to the player and one card to the dealer, all face up. The player then decides whether to "hit" (ask for another card) or "stand" (keep the current hand). The goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points, numbered cards are worth their face value, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial to the player.
The game continues until the player decides to quit or runs out of money. It provides a simple interface for placing bets, receiving cards, and making decisions during gameplay.
